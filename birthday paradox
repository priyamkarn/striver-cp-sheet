for 40 percent probability
To calculate the minimum number of people needed for a 40% probability of at least two people having the same birthday, we can modify the code as follows:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    double prob = 1.0;
    int n = 0;

    while (prob > 0.6) {
        n++;
        prob *= (365.0 - n + 1) / 365.0;
    }

    cout << n << endl;

    return 0;
}
Here, we set prob to 1 and initialize n to 0. We then enter a loop that keeps iterating until the probability prob drops below 0.6 
(since we want a 40% probability, which is equivalent to a 60% probability of no two people having the same birthday). Inside the loop,
we increment n by 1 and calculate the probability of no two people having the same birthday, just like in the previous code. 
We then multiply this probability with prob to get the cumulative probability. We keep iterating until prob drops below 0.6.

Finally, we print the value of n, which gives us the minimum number of people needed for a 40% probability of at least two people having the same birthday.
